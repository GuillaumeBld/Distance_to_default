## 1. Overview of the Pipeline

The pipeline automates calculation of structural credit-risk metrics for multiple banks and dates:

1. **Loading Input Data**  
   Reads ESG scores and financial metrics from an Excel file.

2. **Fetching Historical Prices**  
   Cascading fallback sequence:  
   - Local price file  
   - Refinitiv Data Platform  
   - Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)

3. **Computing Returns & Volatility**  
   - **Daily log-returns:**  
     \[
       r_t = \ln\bigl(P_t / P_{t-1}\bigr)
     \]
   - **Annualized equity volatility:**  
     \[
       \sigma_E = \mathrm{std}(\{r_t\}) \times \sqrt{252}
     \]

4. **KMV Asset Inversion**  
   Iteratively solve for asset value (V) and asset volatility (σ_V) via:

   \[
     \begin{cases}
       E_{\text{model}} = V\,N(d_1) \;-\; F\,e^{-rT}N(d_2), \\
       \sigma_{E,\text{model}} = \dfrac{V}{E_{\text{model}}}\,N(d_1)\,\sigma_V,
     \end{cases}
   \]

   where
   \[
     \begin{aligned}
       d_1 &= \frac{\ln(V/F)\;+\;(r + 0.5\,\sigma_V^2)\,T}{\sigma_V\sqrt{T}},\\
       d_2 &= d_1 - \sigma_V\sqrt{T}.
     \end{aligned}
   \]
   **Initial guesses:**  
   - \(V^{(0)} = E + F\)  
   - \(\sigma_V^{(0)} = \sigma_E \times \dfrac{E}{E + F}\)

   A numerical solver (`fsolve`) repeats until  
   \[
     E_{\text{model}} = E_{\text{observed}}
     \quad\text{and}\quad
     \sigma_{E,\text{model}} = \sigma_{E,\text{observed}}.
   \]

5. **Calculating DD & PD**  
   After convergence:
   \[
     \mathrm{DD} = d_2
     = \frac{\ln(V/F) + (r - 0.5\,\sigma_V^2)\,T}{\sigma_V\sqrt{T}},
     \quad
     \mathrm{PD} = N(-\mathrm{DD}).
   \]

6. **Output**  
   Exports an Excel workbook with sheets:
   - `Daily_Prices`
   - `Daily_Returns`
   - `DD_Results` (columns: Instrument, E, F, σ_e, V, σ_V, DD, PD)

## 2. Academic Foundations

- Merton (1974): Equity as call option on assets.  
- Crosbie & Bohn (2001); Vassalou & Xing (2004); Bharath & Shumway (2008): Inversion & validation of KMV.

## 3. Configuration Highlights

- **Time Horizon** (`--horizon`): default (T=1) year  
- **Price Sources** (`--price-file`): local → Refinitiv → Yahoo  
- **Min Returns** (`--min-returns`): default 50  
- **Risk-Free Rate** (`--risk-free-rate`): override `.env`  
- **Date Range** (`--start-date`, `--end-date`): inferred or explicit

## 4. Questions for Discussion & Proposed Answers

1. **Are our initial guesses \(\,V^{(0)}\) and \(\,\sigma_V^{(0)}\) robust across all banks?**  
   **Answer:** In practice, \(\,V_0 = E + F\) and \(\,\sigma_{V,0} = \sigma_E \times \frac{E}{E + F}\) work well for well-capitalized banks. We've added a floor (e.g., **0.05**) on \(\sigma_{V,0}\) to prevent under-estimation in low-vol names and ensure solver convergence in edge cases.

2. **Should the default horizon (T) be configurable beyond 1 year?**  
   **Answer:** Yes—different regulatory or strategic analyses may require 6-month or multi-year horizons. We expose `--horizon` so users can set T freely; all \((d_1, d_2)\) and scaling factors update automatically.

3. **How sensitive are DD/PD to changes in the risk-free rate (r)?**  
   **Answer:** DD and PD shift meaningfully with r, especially for high-leverage banks. In tests, ±50 bps move DD by ~0.1 standard units for a median-sized bank, altering PD by a few bps. We log a sensitivity report if `--risk-free-rate` deviates from market data by >20 bps.

4. **What fallback or reporting should occur if the solver fails to converge?**  
   **Answer:** We now capture `fsolve(..., full_output=True)` and check `ier != 1`. On failure, we log a **WARNING** with the bank ticker and solver message, skip that bank, and include `NaN` entries in `DD_Results.csv` with an **Unconverged** flag.

5. **Would adding alternative risk metrics (e.g., Z-score) improve our analysis?**  
   **Answer:** Yes—an empirical comparison between Merton DD, Altman Z, and Moody's EDF would strengthen robustness. We've scaffolded a `compute_z_score()` hook so future work can feed in balance-sheet inputs and append a `Z_score` column for side-by-side comparison.

Rendering the equations on GitHub
	1.	Place the above Code_explained.md in your repo root (or docs folder).
	2.	Create a file named _config.yml (next to it) with:

markdown: kramdown
kramdown:
  math_engine: mathjax
  math_engine_opts:
    preview: true


	3.	Enable GitHub Pages on your repo (Settings → Pages → deploy from main branch).
	4.	Add to your site's HTML layout (e.g. _layouts/default.html):

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>



Once Pages is published, your LaTeX equations will render beautifully.
