# Step-by-Step: What the Bank Risk Analysis Tool Actually Does

## 1. Initialization and Logging
- The tool starts and sets up a log to record all actions, warnings, and errors for audit and troubleshooting.

## 2. Input and Configuration
- It reads your instructions (from command-line options or settings), such as which Excel file to use, which sheet, and any custom parameters (like risk-free rate or analysis period).
- It checks that your system has the required software and Python version.

## 3. Load Environment Variables
- The tool loads key settings, such as the risk-free rate (used in default probability calculations) and any credentials for financial data providers.

## 4. Data Ingestion
- It opens your Excel file and checks for all required columns:
  - Bank identifier (ticker or name)
  - Date
  - Price to Book Value per Share
  - Total Assets
  - Total Debt
  - (Optionally) ESG scores
- It standardizes and cleans the data, ensuring all numbers are in the correct format and dates are properly recognized.

## 5. Market Data Acquisition
- For each bank, the tool attempts to obtain historical equity prices for the analysis period:
  1. **First**, it looks for a local file with price data.
  2. **If not found**, it tries to fetch prices from Refinitiv (if you have access).
  3. **If that fails**, it fetches prices from Yahoo Finance as a fallback.
- If no price data can be found, the process stops and you are notified.

## 6. Return Calculation
- Using the price data, the tool calculates daily returns for each bank's equity. This is essential for volatility estimation.

## 7. KMV Model Application
- For each bank and date, the tool applies the KMV structural credit risk model:
  - **Market Value of Equity** is estimated using Price to Book and balance sheet data.
  - **Asset Value** is inferred as the sum of market equity and total debt.
  - **Asset Volatility** is estimated from the equity return volatility.
  - **Distance-to-Default (DD)** is calculated: this measures how many standard deviations the bank's asset value is above its default point (total debt).
  - **Probability of Default (PD)** is derived from DD using the normal distribution, giving a forward-looking default risk estimate.

## 8. ESG Integration
- If ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) scores are present, they are included in the output, allowing you to see how sustainability factors correlate with risk.

## 9. Model Validation (Optional)
- If you provide a file of known default events, the tool compares its predictions to actual defaults, helping you assess the model's predictive power.

## 10. Result Export
- The tool generates a comprehensive Excel report containing:
  - The original and processed data
  - Calculated risk metrics (DD, PD, volatilities)
  - Color-coded risk levels (e.g., green for safe, red for high risk)
  - Summary statistics (averages, medians, etc.)
  - The price and return series used in the analysis
  - The parameters and settings used for transparency

## 11. Completion and Logging
- The tool saves the results and log file in your working directory.
- It provides a summary of what was done and where to find the outputs.
- If any errors occurred, they are clearly reported for follow-up.

**Summary for Financial Professionals:**  
This tool automates the process of ingesting bank financials and market data, applies the KMV model to estimate each bank's distance to default and probability of default, integrates ESG scores, and produces a detailed, audit-ready Excel report for risk monitoring and regulatory or internal review.
